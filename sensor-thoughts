Since our robot will have to eventually go around the CEL in a shape that has lots of right angles, I think it would be a good idea to have distance-sensing sensors on both the front and the right side of the robot. While we could just have a spinning head with a single set of sensors, that seems like an extra complication that could easily break during the race: turning to the right 90deg and then forward again time and again makes me think that there will be enough error in the motor to make the head no longer directly forward after a while. In addition it could waste time during the time trial to have to wait for the head rather than just always having a sensor on and always having that data ready. Also since we only need to move counter-clockwise I can't think of a good reason why we'd need a sensor on the left. I could be missing something, though.

We should also do tests on how well the wheels move in a deterministic fashion. That is, are the wheels guarenteed to move an inch no matter how much weight is on the rig? The professor may have already mentioned whether this is true, but I don't remember him mentioning it. If it's true that will simplify a few things and make moving much more reliable, but if it isn't true we may need to add a sensor which measures how far the rig has moved (think a wheel on the ground that counts revolutions).

Also I think it's a really good idea to get an electric compass, that way the robot will be able to orient itself more easily (and that way we can apply a rotation matrix to the front and side sensor so that the robot can create a 2D map of the race (and eventually obstacles). Depending on the precision of the wheels we may actually be able to calculate this based on how much we've told each wheel to move, but that may not work out if the wheels have a bit of error since that sort of error could get much larger when constantly summing.
